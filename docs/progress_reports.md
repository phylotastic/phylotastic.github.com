# Quarterly (?) progress reports

## Purpose and format

I'm not sure how often we want to do this.  The goal is to track progress so that (1) we can understand how ideas emerge, turn into plans, and then into outputs, and (2) we always have a list of recent accomplishments handy if we want to write a progress report, make a presentation, or do some publicity. 

Each section will have a quarterly report of progress, with sections from each center, and for the entire project.   Please keep these brief.  List accomplishments, challenges identified, and level of effort devoted to different tasks.
