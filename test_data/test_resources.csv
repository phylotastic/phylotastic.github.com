Riek (2011), ""Allometry of milk intake at peak lactation"" (Mamm. biol. 76: 3–11).  The article has text, figures, and table listing 42 species used in phylogenetic character analysis of lactation.  The analysis uses a subtree extracted from the Bininda-Emonds supertree of 4K mammals.  Arlin has a complete set of outputs for this.
